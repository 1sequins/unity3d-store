*This project is a part of [The SOOMLA Project](http://project.soom.la) which is a series of open source initiatives with a joint goal to help mobile game developers get better stores and more in-app purchases.*

Didn't you ever wanted an in-app purchase one liner that looks like this ?!

```cs
    StoreController.BuyCurrencyPack("[Product id here]");
```

The unity3d-store is the Unity3D flavour of The SOOMLA Project. This project uses [android-store](https://github.com/soomla/android-store) and [ios-store](https://github.com/soomla/ios-store) in order to provide game developers with in-app billing for their **Unity3D** projects.
    
**Before you start**, we suggest that you go over the information in ios-store and android-store so you get acquainted with the SOOMLA framework:
- ios-store [project](https://github.com/soomla/ios-store) [wiki](https://github.com/soomla/ios-store/wiki)
- android-store [project](https://github.com/soomla/android-store) [wiki](https://github.com/soomla/android-store/wiki)

>Soon, SOOMLA is going to provide developers with storefront capabilities through [Store Designer](designer.soom.la).
